# Point Spread Function Modeling of Cometary Comae
Comae are the nebulous structures surrounding comets consisting of ice and dust that form due to sublimation as comets pass close to the sun. Cometary nuclei are often obscured by these comae, making it difficult to determine where exactly the nucleus is. Because comets and comet-like objects such as Centaurs are so small and far away, accuracy is needed on the scale of milli-arcseconds (less than 1 pixel in a typical image), causing even the smallest differences in centroided location of the nucleus have significant consequences on the accuracy of astrometric calculations and ephemerides.                
The process of deriving the position of the cometary nucleus in an image involves fitting a circular gaussian point spread function to the image signal in order to obtain sub-pixel precision. However, this process does not take into account the asymmetric nature of cometary comae, and literature suggests that signal from the coma drops off at a rate proportional to 1/r from the nucleus. This project aims to apply this finding to the creation of a new model of cometary comae that can more accurately and consistently determine the true location of the comet nucleus. In doing so, the goal is to potentially improve the accuracy of astrometric calculations of comets and Centaurs as well as their associated ephemerides, which can allow for better prediction of the stellar occultations of these bodies.
